There are a few setup steps to effectively use this app on your computer.

1 download or clone this on a computer that has Node.js and MongoDB already installed.

2 On the CMD 'command' Terminal run mongod to start mongodb.

3 In your text editor terminal (I use visual studio code) 'run node app.js' because we want the server to listen to port 3000

4 Then in a seperate terminal window 'run npm start' to boot react. Listen to a different port.

5 ENABLE CROSS ORIGIN RESOURCE SHARING or you will get an error because our app is trying to communicate with an API running on a different URL. I use a crome extension called Allow-Control-Allow-Origin.

I hope its not too complicated. "# profile_project_React_Plus_Node" 
"# profile_project_React_Redux_Node_SSR"
